# Bear, River, Fish

We are going to build a small ecosystem! We want to create an ecosystem made up of 3 parts: bears, river and fish. You will need a class for each of these. From this you can make instances and build your ecosystem.

Create an app.js to instantiate objects and console.log so that you can see your classes working.

## How Our Ecosystem Works

- A fish should have a name

- A river should have a name e.g. "Amazon"
- A river should hold many fish
- A river should lose a fish when a bear takes a fish
- A river should have a fishCount method

- A bear should have a name e.g. "Yogi" and a type e.g. "Grizzly"
- A bear should have an empty belly ( maybe an array )
- A bear should have a roar method
- A bear should have a foodCount method
- A bear should be able to take a fish from the river
